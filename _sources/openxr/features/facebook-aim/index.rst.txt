What does it do?
-----------

This feature is implicitly provided by our OpenXR layer and an application can make use of it by leveraging
the `XR_FB_hand_tracking_aim <https://registry.khronos.org/OpenXR/specs/1.0/html/xrspec.html#XR_FB_hand_tracking_aim>`_
extension. It provides typical far field gesture state for query.

This features data is chained from the ``XR_EXT_hand_tracking``'s' ``xrLocateHandJointsEXT`` and supplies the
following information:

* Status Flags
* Aim Pose
* Index finger Pinch Strength
* Middle finger Pinch Strength
* Ring finger Pinch Strength
* Little finger Pinch Strength

The ``Status Flags`` are flag bits that determine whether or not the data described above is in a valid state
to read. The dominant hand described in the ``Status Flags`` is set via the above configuration variable and
defaults to the right hand being the dominant hand.

.. note::
  The bits for the flags ``XR_HAND_TRACKING_AIM_MENU_PRESSED_BIT_FB`` and 
  ``XR_HAND_TRACKING_AIM_SYSTEM_GESTURE_BIT_FB`` will always be unset as to not conflict with typical system
  gestures.
