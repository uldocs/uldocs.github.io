*********

This feature is enabled implicitly and functionality of the feature can be accessed via the

What does it do?
-----------

This feature extends upon the existing ``XR_EXT_hand_tracking``'s ``XrHandJointSetEXT`` to include an additional
joint to represent the users elbow.

When using this feature, requesting hand joints via ``xrLocateHandJointsEXT`` will also include the elbow joint,
allowing for an accurate representation of the users forearm if desired.
