        * - ``ULTRALEAP_OPENXR_POS_X``
          - ``X``

        * - ``ULTRALEAP_OPENXR_POS_Y``
          - ``Y``
          - where ``Y`` is a float offset in **meters** along the y-axis.
          - ``0.0``
        * - ``ULTRALEAP_OPENXR_POS_Z``
          - ``Z``
          - where ``Z`` is a float offset in **meters** along the z-axis.
          - ``-0.08``
        * - ``ULTRALEAP_OPENXR_TILT_ANGLE``
          - ``DEG``
          - where ``DEG`` is an integer tilt angle downwards in **degrees** from the forward facing horizontal.
          - ``0``

    .. note::
        Setting even only one of ``ULTRALEAP_OPENXR_POS_X``, ``ULTRALEAP_OPENXR_POS_Y`` or ``ULTRALEAP_OPENXR_POS_Z`` 
        will mean all values from the JSON configuration are overridden. 
        The ones that aren't set will fall back to defaults.


What does it do?
------------

When using an Ultraleap tracking device it assumes the center of the device is at the 
center of your vision; also known your `Interpupillary Median <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pupillary_distance>`_.

This in reality however isn't the case when `mounting the device <../../../hand-tracking/XR-Setup/XR-setup.html>`_ 
to a HMD. Without compensating for this forward offset, your hands in XR appear closer to you than
they actually are. This also applies to if the mount isn't directly centered on the HMD or the mount has a tilt
like the Leap Motion Controller 2 mount shown below:

   :align: center


By using the tracker mounting configuration options we can account for these discrepancies 
to ensure your hands appear correctly positioned in XR.

How to use it
------------

If your HMD and mount is found under the `mounting your camera <../../../hand-tracking/XR-Setup/XR-setup.html>`_
section; follow the recommended mounting positions in order to avoid blocking HMD cameras and sensors.

Otherwise mount the Ultraleap tracking device onto your HMD, keeping the device as closely to the
``Interpupillary Median`` as possible being cautious to not block any of the HMDs camera or sensors.

Once the tracker is mounted measure the distance for the ``[X,Y,Z]`` axis', set the according
decimal values in the corresponding configurables remembering that the values are in **Meters**;
Whilst also accounting for any downward tilt of your mount in **Degrees**.

.. note::
    In OpenXR the ``Z`` axis is actually pointing towards you as opposed to away from you.
    Therefore when setting the ``Z`` axis offset for the tracker you need to use a negative value.
    E.G the default of ``-0.08`` to represent the ``8cm`` offset of the tracker in the image above.
