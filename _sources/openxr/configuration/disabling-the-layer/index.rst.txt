What does it do?
-----------

When this configuration is set, our OpenXR layer will not be loaded via the OpenXR loader.
This can be very useful for debugging purposes to see if the layer is causing any issues that
we may have missed!

Alternatively, if you are on ``Windows`` and have our control panel open. You can also disable
it via the toggle in the settings pane:

.. figure:: ../../../img/openxr/control-panel-settings-pane.png
   :width: 90%
   :alt: The settings pane of the control panel with the OpenXR toggle highlighted.
   :align: center

If you have found an issue with our layer enabled that isn't there when it's disabled;
`Let us know! <https://support.leapmotion.com/hc/en-us/requests/new>`_.

.. note::
    This cannot be done via the configuration file, unlike most configurables.
