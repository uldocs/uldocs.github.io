      Our OpenXR layer comes with a number of configurable options and feature flags to allow more fine control over the layer itself.
      This can leveraged in two ways, either through using a <a href="./index.html#configuration-file">configuration file (recommended)</a> 
      or through the use of <a href="./index.html#id10">environment variables</a>.

    Once you've set up your preferred method of configuration the table below shows all the layer's configurable options.
    These same methods are also used to set any <a href="../features/index.html">feature flags</a> you may want to use.

Configuration File
-----------

All of the layer's configurable options (including `feature flags <../features/index.html>`_) can be set using key value pairs in `JSON <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON>`_.

.. Note::
  This is the recommended way of setting any configurations, as this file is parsed every time an application using our layer is started. 
  This differs to `environment variables <./index.html#id10>`_ as these are only updated when you close and reopen your OpenXR program. 

  For example, if developing in Unity and using `environment variables <./index.html#id10>`_, you would be required to close and reopen Unity every time you made a configuration change.
  Where as with the `configuration file <./index.html#configuration-file>`_ this isn't necessary.

Firstly, navigate to the appropriate path for your operating system below:

* Windows:
   * ``%PROGRAMDATA%\Ultraleap\OpenXR``
* Linux:
   * System-wide: ``/etc/ultraleap``
   * Per-user: ``~/.config/ultraleap`` (Overrides System-wide configuration if present)

Then create a new file in that directory called ``api_layer_config.json`` and open it up.

Additions to the file should be done in a key-value pair format where the key is the configurable variable and the value is the desired setting:
::
  {
    "CONFIG_KEY1_STRING": "HelloWorld",
    "CONFIG_KEY2_BOOL": false,
    "CONFIG_KEY3_VECTOR": [1,2,3]
  }

Below is a simple example of the configuration file to get you started. 
It sets `logging level <./logging/index.html>`_ to ``warn``, and the `tracker offset <./tracker-mounting/index.html>`_ to **8cm** forward from the midpoint of your interpupillary distance with no tilt:

::

  {
    "log_level": "warn",
    "pos": [0, 0, -0.08],
    "tilt_angle": 0
  }

.. note::
  If you're making use of both the `configuration file <./index.html#configuration-file>`_ and `environment variables <./index.html#id10>`_
  then `environment variables <./index.html#id10>`_ override their `configuration file <./index.html#configuration-file>`_ counterpart. 

  If you run into a scenario where the `configuration file <./index.html#configuration-file>`_ isn't working, double check your `environment variables <./index.html#id10>`_!

.. note::
  JSON can be picky with its syntax and prone to mistakes, it's always good practice to run your file through a `JSON validator <https://jsonlint.com/>` to ensure it is error-free.

More information regarding both of these configuration options, and all other possible additions to the configuration file can be found under the `configuration <./index.html#configuration>`_ and `features <../features/index.html>`_ sections.

Environment Variables
-----------

Any of the configuration options can also be set using environment variables. If set, these **override** the values from the 
configuration file.

.. note::
  These environment variables must be set prior to the OpenXR application starting, and if left unset first fall back to the 
  `configuration file <./index.html#configuration-file>`_ settings and then default values failing that.

Environment variable keys for our layer are fully upper-case and prefixed with ``ULTRALEAP_OPENXR_``.

For example, the key ``tilt_angle`` from `tracker mounting <./tracker-mounting/index.html>`_'s equivalent environment variable is ``ULTRALEAP_OPENXR_TILT_ANGLE``.

.. note::
  The environment variable key-value pairs are the same on all platforms.

To see what options you can configure with environment variables check out the `table above <./index.html#configuration>`_ for configuration options
or head over to the `features page <../features/index.html>`_.
