OpenXR Support 
*********

Ultraleap support for OpenXR means you can switch between LeapC and OpenXR data in real time. 
This can be achieved using the blueprint shown in the image below, ``Set Leap Options`` node, 
and by ticking the Boolean ``Options Use OpenXR As Source`` to true, UE will be using OpenXR as a source 
for data. Leaving the Boolean to be false will default to use the LeapC data.
