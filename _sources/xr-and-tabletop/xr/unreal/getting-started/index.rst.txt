Pre-requisites
------------

* An `Ultraleap Hand Tracking Camera <https://leap2.ultraleap.com/leap-motion-controller-2/>`_.
* A computer that meets the `Tracking Requirements <https://leap2.ultraleap.com/gemini-downloads/>`_.
* `Ultraleap Tracking Software (V5.2+) <https://leap2.ultraleap.com/gemini-downloads/>`_ installed on both the development computer and your XR device if it's standalone.
* `Unreal 4.27 or 5.2 <https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/download>`_.
* An XR runtime plugin. `OpenXR <https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.openxr@1.7/manual/index.html>`_ is the most common, but you may require a specific plugin if OpenXR is not supported. For example `Pico <https://developer-global.pico-interactive.com/document/unity/>`_, `HTC Vive <https://developer.vive.com/resources/vive-wave/tutorials/installing-wave-xr-plugin-unity/>`_ or `Meta Quest <https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/unity/unity-gs-overview/>`_.

.. warning:: We no longer support the use of the SteamVR plugin on UE 4.27 with our OpenXR layer. However, our LeapC implementation will still work with the SteamVR plugin enabled on UE 4.27.

How to get the Plugin
-----------

As a developer you have two options to get our plugin; via the Unreal Marketplace (`recommended`) or from our Github Repository manually.

.. tabbed:: Unreal Marketplace

    1. Open the Epic Games launcher.
    2. Select the Marketplace tab and search for ``Ultraleap``.
    3. Click ``Install to Engine`` then select an engine version and click the install button.

    4. Create a new project or launch an existing one.
    5. Once the Unreal Engine project is open select ``Project Settings`` then ``Plugins``.
    6. There is an ``Input`` section near the top of the Plugins list, the ``Ultraleap Tracking Plugin`` should be available and enabled.

.. tabbed:: Github Repository

    1. Download the latest release of the Ultraleap Unreal Plugin and SDK (make sure to use the `.zip link for your version of Unreal <https://github.com/ultraleap/UnrealPlugin/releases>`_).
    2. Create a new project or launch an existing one.
    3. Create a ``Plugins`` folder in your project root folder (`if one doesn't already exist`).
    4. Drag the unzipped ``Ultraleap Tracking plugin`` into the project's ``Plugins`` folder.

How to use the Plugin
------------

There are two methods that can be used to start tracking your hands. Either via our custom ``Pawn`` or our custom ``Game Mode``.

.. tabbed:: Leap Hands Pawn 

    1. Ensure the plugin is enabled in the project, restarting when necessary
    2. Open up an existing level or create a new one.
    3. Change your default ``Pawn`` to ``LeapHandsPawn`` or place it in the level.
    4. Select the ``LeapHandsPawn`` and open the ``Details`` Window.
    5. Locate the Pawn subsection and change the ``Auto Possess Player`` to ``Player 0``.
    6. Now press ``Play in VR Preview``.
    7. Move your hands in front of you to check hand tracking is working. The virtual hands should track the movement of the real hands.

    **Please ensure that you're ready to stream VR before starting Unreal otherwise VR Preview will not be available - e.g. ensure SteamVR is running.**

.. tabbed:: IE Game Mode

    1. Ensure the plugin is enabled in the project, restarting when necessary
    2. Open any level that has an existing ``Player Start`` set up.
    3. Open the ``World Settings`` window on the editor.
    4. Within the ``Game Mode`` section, select ``IEGameMode`` from the ``GameMode Override`` dropdown.
    5. Press Play.
    6. Move your hands in front of you to check hand tracking is working. The virtual hands should track the movement of the real hands.
