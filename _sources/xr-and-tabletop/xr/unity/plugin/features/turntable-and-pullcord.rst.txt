This example provides assets that enable you to add object or product explorer style turntables to your applications. It also provides an example of a pull cord which triggers events to use when in different states.

Tips
-----

You can modify the visuals and functionality of both the Turntable and the Pull Cord within the scene:

For the Turntable, locate the Turntable Gameobject (Table/Turntable) and try changing the parameters on the Turntable component.

For the Pull Cord, locate the Pull Cord Gameobject (Table/Pull Cord) and try moving its children `Pull Cord Start` and `Pull Cord End` in the scene. You can also modify the Pull Cord functionality by changing parameters such as `Resting Point` or `Explosion Point` on the Pull Cord component.

What Code was used to build the example?
----------------------------------------
This example comes with a series of scripts and assets, the code included is:

**Turntable:**

|Turntable| - This is responsible for rotating the turntable whenever any fingertips are intersecting with it. It also calls `TurntableVisuals.UpdateVisuals()` when any turntable parameters have changed.

|TurntableVisuals| - This creates a circle with a line renderer and dashes with drawMeshInstanced. It takes info such as the height and radius of the turntable from Turntable.cs.

**PullCord:**

|PullCord| - PullCord updates the handle projection position,
updates the resting position for the pullCordHandle,
provides a value for the progress of the pull cord
and updates the exploding items.

|PullCordHandle| - PullCordHandle keeps track of the handle's position and moves it according to hand attraction and pinching.

|PullCordVisuals| - PullCordVisuals updates the pull cord visuals depending on the pull cord state.
