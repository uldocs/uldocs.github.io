Haptics | How our virtual touch technology works
################################################

Discover how our haptic technology creates the sense of touch in mid-air.

Find out more about `Ultraleap's haptics hardware <https://www.ultraleap.com/haptics/>`_ and
`software <https://developer.ultrahaptics.com/>`_.

To add mid-air haptics, you’ll need either a
`STRATOS Explore <https://www.ultraleap.com/product/stratos-explore/>`_ or
`STRATOS Inspire <https://www.ultraleap.com/product/stratos-inspire/>`_ haptic module. Both come with a Leap Motion
Controller included, so this single unit is all you need for both hand tracking and haptics. They also require the
`Ultraleap Haptics SDK <https://developer.ultrahaptics.com/faq/getting-started/>`_ to run.
