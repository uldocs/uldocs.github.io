Our CPV tool helps kiosk manufacturers and integrators determine the ideal positioning of the Ultraleap Hand Tracking Camera.
You can visualize and customize different screen sizes and orientations. You can try different camera positions to find the best placement and angle for your needs, and model the tracking zones and field of view.

      - Between 10 cm to 75 cm preferred, up to 1 m maximum
      - Between 10 cm to 60 cm preferred, up to 80 cm maximum
      - Between 10 cm to 75 cm preferred, up to 1 m maximum
    * - **Field of view**

Make sure there are minimal infrared (IR) sources and reflections in the camera's field-of-view. These can reduce the quality of hand tracking.

Digital screens can act as mirrors, creating IR glare from the camera module’s own LEDs. To avoid this, place the camera outside the screen’s projection plane.

Operating your Ultraleap camera in bright sunlight may also impact performance. To improve performance, consider changing your camera placement.

We recommend opening the Ultraleap Tracking Control Panel and using the **Visualizer** to check that hand tracking is operating as expected.

For more details see :doc:`Testing Hand Tracking <testing-hand-tracking>`.

*Camera should be placed outside of the screen’s projection plane. Try to maintain this even when screen is tilted.*

*Make sure there are no obstructions within the field of view of the camera. The background should be as simple as possible.*

*Use the Visualizer to check for obstructions. In this example, hands are not tracked even though they are in the centre of the camera module’s field of view.*
