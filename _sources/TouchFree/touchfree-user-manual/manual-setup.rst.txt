Manual Setup
============

Use Manual Setup if you want to refine your setup with known distances and angles for your kiosk screen and camera position.

Screen Height
-------------

Screen height is measured in centimetres from the bottom edge of the screen (excluding the bezel) to the top edge of the screen (excluding the bezel).

.. Note:: Screen width is not needed here because TouchFree uses your screen resolution to determine the aspect ratio of the screen.

Screen Tilt
-----------

Screen tilt is measured in degrees with **positive** values tilting the screen **backwards** and **negative** values tilting the screen **forward**. This tilts around the bottom edge of the screen (excluding the bezel).

Camera Distance from Screen
---------------------------

Camera Distance from Screen is measured in centimetres from the bottom edge of the screen (excluding the bezel). **Positive** values represent a position **in front** of the screen.

.. note:: It is unlikely that this value would be negative.

Camera Rotation
---------------

Camera Rotation is measured in degrees with 0 facing up, **positive** values **towards** the screen and **negative** values **away from** the screen.

.. note:: see **Measurement Notes** for more information on these rotations.

Camera Left to Right
--------------------

Camera Left to Right is measured in centimetres from the middle of the bottom edge of the screen (excluding the bezel) to the middle centre of the Ultraleap camera. **Positive** values represent a position to the **right** of the screen when facing it. **Negative** values represent a position to the **left** of the screen when facing it.

Camera Height
-------------

Camera Height is measured in centimetres from the middle of the bottom edge of the screen (excluding the bezel) to the middle centre of the Ultraleap camera. **Positive** values represent a position **above** the bottom edge of the screen (excluding the bezel). **Negative** values represent a position **below** the bottom edge of the screen (excluding the bezel).

Measurement Notes
-----------------

Distances for relative screen-camera placement are taken from the bottom-centre screen pixel row, to the top centre of the Ultraleap camera module.

Angles are measured relative to 0Â° being directly upwards in the room, regardless of orientation or position. *Note: this has changed since TouchFree 1.1.*
