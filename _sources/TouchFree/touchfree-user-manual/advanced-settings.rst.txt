Configuration File Location
###########################

In some kiosk scenarios, the default file location for the **Configuration Files** may be inaccessible due to permissions. In **Advanced Settings** you can select an alternate location for the configuration files. We do not recommend changing this location except to avoid permissions issues.

In most cases these settings should not be changed.

.. Note:: If you select an alternate location, TouchFree Service may not be able to read or edit the config files unless it is launched in Administrator mode.


Custom IP and Port
###########################

TouchFree runs over ``localhost:9739`` by default, however it can be configured to utilise a different port or IP by manually modifying the ``ServicePort`` and ``ServiceIP`` values respectively within **ServiceConfig.json**.

This config file can be found in your **Configuration File Location**, as detailed above.

.. Note:: Changing the port and/or IP will require a manual restart of the TouchFree service for the changes to take effect.
