The Essentials
--------------

TouchFree Application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The TouchFree Application runs invisibly on top of existing user interfaces. Perfect for retrofitting systems with no need to modify your existing application’s user interface or change a single line of code. It provides a cursor that users control touchlessly and communicates with Windows’ input system to control your application.

The TouchFree Application can also be used to evaluate the capabilities of TouchFree in advance of integrating TouchFree Tooling into your own Web or Unity applications.

TouchFree Tooling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

TouchFree Tooling enables Web and Unity developers to integrate TouchFree’s touchless technology into their target applications as a native feature. More detailed information, including Quick Start Guides, can be found within the TouchFree Tooling packages for Web and Unity.

TouchFree Service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

TouchFree Service is the engine of TouchFree and is required to power both TouchFree Application and developed applications integrated with TouchFree Tooling.

The TouchFree Service converts hand movements, provided by Ultraleap’s hand tracking cameras, into positional data that the TouchFree Application (or your own touchless application) can use to represent a cursor on screen.
