3Di Mounting Solutions
**********************

There are a series of different mounting solutions for the Ultraleap 3Di. To explore further options, obtain a CAD file of any of the mounts or for support please contact us via support@ultraleap.com.

Multi Mount
--------------------------------

The Multi Mount holds the Ultraleap 3Di securely to kiosk or screen, and can be used in desktop mode. It provides optimum camera placement for evaluation and deployment. Designed by Ultraleap’s team of engineers, it can be attached to a wide range of displays with straight forward installation, minimal retrofitting and easy cleaning. The Multi Mount can also sit on any horizontal surface to support desktop evaluation or deployments.

Step 2: Option B

Peel off the red backing paper on both strips being careful not to touch the sticky underside and place directly at the bottom of the kiosk/screen pointing up.

Panel Mount Kit
------------------------------------

The Panel Mount Kit is a permanent mounting solution, protecting the camera, cable, and connection from users and the elements. Use the Panel Mount Kit for flush mounting of the 3Di within display panels (supports panel thicknesses from 2- 8 mm).

To integrate:

1. Determine shim configuration based on panel thickness from the table below.
2. Provision for the cutout in the panel.
3. Configure shims as per the table below. The shims and bracket load from rear of panel, 3Di loads from the front
