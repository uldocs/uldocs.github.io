Advanced Hand Tracking With Tom Carter
**************************************

Join Ultraleap founder and CTO Tom Carter for an interview on state of the art hand tracking, and what the future holds.

This deep dive into the future of hand interaction technology was given in October 2020 as part of the

Tom gives us his unique perspective on the adoption of hand tracking in XR, Open XR, as well as a Q&A session that
covers accessibility, touch free screens, enterprise use cases, and automotive. Tom also explains the key advantages
of Ultraleap camera modules over other providers.
