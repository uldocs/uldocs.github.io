Pose Detection in Unreal
*****************************

*Jim Simons, Senior Unreal Engineer*

**PoseDetector**-derived components are easy-to-use building blocks that detect and generate events from various hand poses such as **thumbs up** and **palm facing inwards**.

They’re a convenient way to detect what a user’s hand is doing. For example, detect when the fingers of a hand are curled or extended, whether a finger or palm is pointing in a particular direction, or whether the hand or fingertip is close to one of a set of target objects.

You can even detect multiple poses together to generate an event (for example Thumbs up AND Proximate/close to an item). There’s no need for coding or complex blueprints.

Our plugin for Unreal Engine 4 connects UE4 applications to hand tracking data, applying real-world physics, UI/UMG input, pre-rigged hand assets and more. 

We’ve recently released an update (available on the Unreal Marketplace) which now includes Pose Detection.

We’ve included a large set of ready-made detectors including commonly used poses such as extended finger, pinch and proximity. 

Want to create more complex behaviours? Use our `Pose Detector Cookbook <https://github.com/ultraleap/UnrealPlugin/blob/main/Documentation/Documentation.md#pose-detector-cookbook>`_ or make your own pose detector.

Detectors can be combined together using a Logic Gate. The **LogicGateDetector** is itself a pose detector component that logically combines two or more other detectors to determine its own state. Need a thumbs up gesture? Combine a thumb extended detector with a thumb pointing upward detector using a logic gate.
