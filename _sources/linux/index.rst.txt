Ultraleap on Linux
****************************************

Ultraleap hand tracking is available for Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish) on x86_64 / amd64 processors.

Before you install Ultraleap's software for the first time, you need to set up the Ultraleap APT repository.
Afterwards, you can install Ultraleap software as you would a normal Ubuntu package.

Installation Instructions
===================================

To add the APT repository, you will need to enter some terminal commands:

1. Add the Ultraleap GPG Key::
   
        wget -qO - https://repo.ultraleap.com/keys/apt/gpg | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/ultraleap.gpg

2. Add the Ultraleap repository to APT::

        echo 'deb [arch=amd64] https://repo.ultraleap.com/apt stable main' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ultraleap.list

3. Update APT::

        sudo apt update

4. Install Ultraleap packages::

        sudo apt install ultraleap-hand-tracking
		
.. note:: If you are prompted to accept the EULA, you may need to press Tab then Enter to accept.

5. EULA - If you weren't prompted to accept the EULA, or declined the EULA then to accept it run::

        leapctl eula


Ultraleap packages

All these packages can be installed with: :code:`sudo apt install ultraleap-hand-tracking`.

Uninstalling packages

Controlling the Ultraleap hand tracking service
