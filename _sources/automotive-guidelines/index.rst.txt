Automotive HMI Guidelines
*************************

Ultraleap’s Experience Design and Research team is building the standards for common gestures, interactions, and haptic
sensations.

This is your guide to best practices for gesture control in automotive HMI.

The automotive HMI of the future is going to use a host of new technologies to respond more intelligently to a driver’s
needs, increasing safety and letting you control your car in a way that’s natural and easy. It will likely be powered by
facial and gesture recognition, voice control, visual displays, eye tracking, and haptic technology.

Ultraleap’s world-leading hand tracking powers reliable, customizable gesture control in automotive HMI – allowing
drivers to control their car’s infotainment system with simple hand gestures.

*Automotive HMI powered by gesture control with mid-air haptics enables drivers to control infotainment intuitively and
without taking their eyes off the road. With thanks to Groupe PSA.*

Adding haptic feedback to gesture control using our “virtual touch” haptic technology gives tactile confirmation that an
action has been completed, even though there’s no button or touchscreen present. Think of it as feeling a “force field”
against your palm.

Our previous high-fidelity explorations proved that fewer glances away from the road occur when using gesture control
augmented with mid-air haptics, compared with a traditional touchscreen interface.

However, gesture control is new enough that there are no established standards yet for how to do things well – unlike,
say, designing for a touchscreen. Our team is building those standards for common gestures, interactions, and haptic
sensations.

Here, we share our current thinking on best-practice gesture frameworks for automotive HMI.
