**********************************************************************
Install and run the Ultraleap Hand Tracking Software on the Pico Neo 3 
**********************************************************************

* If you bought your headset and accessory as a bundle from a distributor your software is preinstalled on your new Pico Neo 3 headset.
* If you purchased an Ultraleap Hand Tracking Accessory to upgrade a headset you already own, the software will come as a zip file from your distributor. Follow the installation instructions below. Your distributor will also give you an SDK agreement.
* Don't have software? Contact our `support team <https://support.leapmotion.com/hc/en-us/requests/new>`_ to get software and a EULA licence.

1. Make sure your headset is turned on.
2. Connect your headset to the PC onto which you have downloaded the APKs. Once the headset has been connected it should be available in your file browser.
3. Copy the APKs to your headset using the file browser - we would recommend you add it to your "Downloads" folder so that it is easy to find it when you are looking for it on your headset.
4. Put on your headset, open your file browser in VR and locate the folder that contains the APKs.
5. Select the APKs you wish to install or update, and choose "Install" or "Update" from the popup that appears.
