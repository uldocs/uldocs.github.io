************************************************
Attach the Mount and Prepare the headset
************************************************

.. note:: Your Ultraleap Stereo IR 170 Hand Tracking Camera comes in a mount, ready to attach to your Pico Neo 3. If you bought your headset and accessory as a bundle from a distributor your camera is already mounted and ready to use.

**CAUTION! The adhesive is semi-permanent. Make sure you are completely happy with the position before sticking the mount into place.**

1. Clean and dry the surface of the headset.
    Make sure the surface is clean and clear of debris before mounting the camera.
    
2. Mark the intended position before you attach the mount to the headset. 
    Position the mount so it is aligned with the black line across the middle of the headset. 
    Match the curvature of the headset to the curvature of the mount. Mark the position.

3. Attach the mount to the front of the headset. 
    Remove the paper backing from the adhesive on the mount and press the mount firmly to the front of the headset in the marked position. 

4. Connect the Micro USB to the Stereo IR 170 Evaluation Kit.
    Do not use the USB-C end - this could damage the connector.

5. Use the cable tie to secure the USB cable at the strain point.
    Cut the cable tie to size.
