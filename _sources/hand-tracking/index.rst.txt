Ultraleap’s hand tracking technology is the world’s fastest and most accurate.

The hardware itself is relatively simple. The magic is in our tracking software and game engine plugins, which combine to
give users a seamless, intuitive, immersive experience.

How it works
############

Hardware
********

`Ultraleap Hand Tracking Cameras <https://www.ultraleap.com/tracking/>`_ have two infrared cameras and multiple
LEDs. The LEDs illuminate your hands with infrared light invisible to the human eye. Image sensors send the data back to
the computer via USB to track your hands.

The light and cameras both operate within a narrow range of the near–infrared spectrum, so they are robust in a range of
environments and lighting conditions.

Software
********

Ultraleap’s Hand Tracking Software models the underlying structure of the hand at the level of the joints and bones.
This means the software can accurately pinpoint the position of a finger or thumb, even if it’s hidden from view.

Our SDK features a C–style API called `LeapC <https://docs.ultraleap.com/tracking-api/index.html>`_. LeapC is designed for accessing tracking data from the Hand Tracking Service, as well as creating bindings to higher–level languages.

Integrations for the Unity and Unreal engines are built on this API. An official binding for C# is available, along with
legacy bindings for C++, Java, JavaScript, Python, and Objective–C.
