**Ultraleap 3Di**

Looking to try out your Ultraleap 3Di Hand Tracking Camera before mounting it on your kiosk?

1. Connect the 3Di to your device using the USB cable included. 

2. Set up your camera with a separate monitor or display, so that the camera is at least 10 cm away from any part of the screen you want to interact with. 

   * *We do not recommend setting up TouchFree on a laptop â€“ supported camera positions cannot be achieved on a laptop.*

3. Make sure the camera is the right way round. Position the notch closest to the user, whether the camera is above or below the screen.
