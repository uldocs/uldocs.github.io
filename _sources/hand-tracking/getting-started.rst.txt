Ultraleap Hand Tracking Cameras
######################

Choose either the `Leap Motion Controller <https://www.ultraleap.com/datasheets/Leap_Motion_Controller_Datasheet.pdf>`_
or the `Stereo IR 170 Camera Module <https://www.ultraleap.com/datasheets/Stereo_IR_170_datasheet.pdf>`_. The Leap
Motion Controller captures the movements of your hands with unparalleled accuracy and near–zero latency. Our
high–performance Stereo IR 170 (formerly known as Rigel) has a wider field of view, longer tracking range, and slimmer
form factor than the Leap Motion Controller.

Build world-leading hand tracking into your application using our developer tools. Download the plugin for your chosen platform to start integrating our tracking data into your creation. Tools are available for Unity, Unreal, OpenXR, and MRTK from the `developer portal <https://leap2.ultraleap.com/xr-developer-tools/>`_. 

Our plugins for the Unity and Unreal game engines make it easy to incorporate hand tracking into your projects.

We provide a full user manual and API reference for both `Unity <https://docs.ultraleap.com/unity-api/>`_ and `Unreal <https://docs.ultraleap.com/unreal-api/>`_ here on our Developer Resources site.

Device Orientation
##################

Our Hand Tracking Software supports three different tracking orientation modes: desktop
(facing up from a table), head–mounted (fastened to a VR/AR headset), and screentop (facing down towards the user).

Orientation mode is set at the application level by the developer. We do not recommend other device orientations.
