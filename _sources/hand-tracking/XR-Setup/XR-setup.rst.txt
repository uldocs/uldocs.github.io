For Leap Motion Controller

If you have a Leap Motion Controller you can use a `VR Developer Mount <https://www.ultraleap.com/vr-controller-mount-whats-included/>`_ to attach the camera module to your headset.

Peel off the sticker, then use the free cable extender bundled with the mount to connect the controller directly to the computer.

For Stereo IR 170
###################

If you have an Ultraleap `Stereo IR 170 <https://www.ultraleap.com/product/stereo-ir-170/>`_ and access to a 3D printer, we recommend `downloading <https://developer.leapmotion.com/s/FC0-02210-00-1.STL>`_ and printing the free Stereo IR 170 Mount (CAD files).

If using the 3D printed mount, attach to the centre of the headset and insert the Stereo IR 170. Otherwise, we recommend using a small strip of velcro in the same position. 

The Stereo IR 170 operates with a typical horizontal and vertical field of view of 170° x 170° and a depth of reliable tracking of 10cm to 75cm. 

**Remove both lens caps from the Stereo IR 170**
