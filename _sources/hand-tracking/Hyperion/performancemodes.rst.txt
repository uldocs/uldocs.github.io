Performance Modes
********************************

Ultraleap offers various modes that enable customers to get the best hand tracking performance, based on device parameters or application context.

Low Power Mode
############

This hint will minimise resource usage of hand tracking to avoid a drop in overall system performance, whilst maintaining smooth tracking. 

It can lead to reduced hand tracking performance so is best for use cases where high fidelity hand tracking is unnecessary, such as basic button interaction.

*   Called via the Hint: LEAP_HINT_LOW_RESOURCE_USAGE

*   Example Use Case(s)

    *   Media consumption

High Performance Mode
############

This hint will maximise resource usage of hand tracking to ensure peak performance.

It is useful for developers who care more about performance than battery life/heat/spare CPU. 

It is best to be used in instances where compute will not be an issue, such as PCVR.

*   Called via the Hint: LEAP_HINT_HIGH_HAND_FIDELITY

*   Example Use Case(s)

    *   Flight simulation

UI Input Mode
############

This hint assumes fingers are fully extended when they out of line of sight of the cameras, making it easier to interact with buttons. 

This is expected only to be used in instances where the user is near UI.

*   Called via the Hint: LEAP_HINT_USER_INPUT

*   Example Use Case(s)

    *   Button pushing

    *   UI panel interactions

Light Robustness Mode
############

This hint will ask the system to adjust the illumination to better suit the environment.

*   Called via the Hint: LEAP_HINT_HIGH_BACKGROUND_ILLUMINATION

*   Example Use Case(s)

    *   Outside usage

Fast Hands Mode
############

This hint makes sure the hand tracking runs as fast as possible to enables hands to be tracked in instances where the user is expected to be moving them quickly.

*   Called via the Hint: LEAP_HINT_FAST_HAND_MOTION

*   Example Use Case(s)

    *   Games or fitness applications
