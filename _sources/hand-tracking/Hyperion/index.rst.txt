Hyperion is Ultraleap’s latest hand tracking technology.

Designed with headset manufacturers and application developers in mind, Hyperion provides access to the latest
and greatest tracking models and modes from Ultraleap.

This highly flexible platform gives you unprecedented control over your hand tracking interactions, allowing you 
to tune different parameters and switch between models to suit your application.

What is included
------------

Hyperion is available to download for Windows, MacOS and Android. The download typically includes the following:

*   **Tracking Service**

    *   The Tracking Service is the software that enables the camera to run hand tracking - it provides hand tracking data for applications that want to use it.

*   **Tracking SDK** 

    *   The Tracking SDK is what you will need if you want to build applications using our C–style API called `LeapC <https://docs.ultraleap.com/tracking-api/index.html>`_. Alternatively you can use our `Unity or Unreal plugins <https://docs.ultraleap.com/xr-and-tabletop/xr/index.html>`_.

*   **Control Panel**

    *   From the Control Panel you can visualise camera feeds, and adjust settings for the Tracking Service and your Ultraleap Hand Tracking Camera.

*   **Commercial license for the Leap Motion Controller 2**

    *   Any purchase of a Leap Motion Controller 2, past or future, includes a license for the camera so that it can be used for commercial purposes. By using the Ultraleap Leap Motion Controller 2 and associated Ultraleap Hyperion tracking software you agree to the terms of this licence. The terms are available `here <https://leap2.ultraleap.com/enterprise-tracking-licence/>`_.

Features
############

While Hyperion unlocks new hand tracking capabilities, it also gives direct access to the Leap Motion Controller 2 stereo IR camera hardware, expanding its use to other computer vision tasks, like depth sensing or 3D scanning. And for the first time, Hyperion expands Ultraleap’s tracking offering to marker tracking, making it possible to track objects.
